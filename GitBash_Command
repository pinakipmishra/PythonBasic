1. How to create new branch and push to github
- Create and checkout to a new branch from your current commit: git checkout -b [branchname]
- Then, push the new branch up to the remote: git push -u origin [branchname]

2. git bash command on how to change branch
- git switch” command and specify the name of the branch you want to switch to. 
If the destination branch does not exist, you have to specify the “-c” option (for “create branch“), 
otherwise you will get an error message when switching to that branch
